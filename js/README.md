### Extra credit requirement 3: Structure, style, and CSS
Added the same on hover styling to the modal close button that's used by the modals previous and next buttons. I added the ```css .btn``` class to the modal close button via JavaScript, and added the ```css transition: .4s ease-out;``` declaration to the ```css .modal-close-btn``` class in the styles.css file.
